# Cellular Automata in Julia and Gtk

This is a code doodle where I'm playing with using Julia to create a Cellular Automata GUI in Gtk.jl. 

To run:

> $  julia -i CA.jl

There are two CAs defined here: 

1. Conway's Game of Life (GoL button)
2. Maze runner CA (MazeRunner button)

Choosing the latter will generate a maze and then click 'start' to start solving the maze.
